 * Availability probing.
 *
 * The gateway does not disclose which models this egress may use: the model
 * listing is a flat id list, and exclusion only appears when a request is
 * refused with a `RegionError`. Availability is therefore established by asking,
 * with the smallest request that can produce a verdict.
 *
 * Egress is watched alongside it because the answer is a property of the
 * network path, not of the account: turning a VPN on changes which models exist
 * for the user, and the picker has to follow without a restart. The cheapest
 * reliable signal is the public address the gateway itself sees.

/**
 * Map one probe failure onto a verdict.
 *
 * The line that matters is whether the gateway *named this model as something it
 * will not route*. Only those readings come from the answer itself: a refusal
 * whose message is about the model (`Model is unavailable`, `not supported`,
 * `no such model`), or a status whose whole meaning is the identifier in the body
 * we sent — 400 for a model it rejects, 404 for one it no longer has, 422 for a
 * route that refuses the pair. Those read as unavailable and the picker drops the
 * model.
 *
 * Everything else says nothing about the model and must not move it:
 * - 5xx, including 503, is the gateway's own trouble. It is the single most
 *   common thing an overloaded pooled account says, and this lane's own history
 *   has it returning 5xx for reasons that had nothing to do with the model
 *   (`src/effort.js` records an upstream 503 from an unknown request field).
 *   Its *words* must not be read as a verdict either: a reverse proxy answers a
 *   503 with the reason phrase "Service Unavailable", and matching that text
 *   took a working model out of the picker.
 * - 401/403/407 is the pooled credential, and 408/425/429 is capacity or
 *   transport — the next window can answer.
 * - no status at all (transport, abort, timeout, a stream that died before any
 *   header) means no answer was received.
 *
 * The asymmetry is deliberate: a stale entry in the picker costs the user one
 * failed turn they can retry, while a model that vanished on a hiccup costs the
 * `reprobe`-then-wait cycle the user has no visibility into.
